## What this is

This is a support package for [grappa](https://github.com/parboiled1/grappa).

Its goal is to include debugging tools such as source code generation from a
parser's bytecode (using [procyon](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon/), and
performance testing.

For the latter, two libraries are in since it is unknown at this time which will
be used:

* [jmh](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/),
* [caliper](https://code.google.com/p/caliper/).
